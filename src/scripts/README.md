# File Structure
There may be an overwhelming amount of files, here are some simple descriptions of each.

`words/`: These are static word files. Don't open!

`typing/`: Library for the typing component.

`mode/`: The typing modes (freetype, timed, words, etc.)

`lib/`: Useful things from stackoverflow, etc. that don't pertain to any previous folders to keep code DRY.

`main.ts`: Entry point, this is where all the code and components are executed.
